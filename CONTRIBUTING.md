## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of `node` installed (`node -v`); tested using `v8.11.x`
1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:ilyakam/gulp-pug-linter.git`
1. `cd gulp-pug-linter`
1. `npm install`

### Testing the Plugin

#### gulp

1. Pick a [rule](https://github.com/pugjs/pug-lint/blob/master/docs/rules.md) that you'd like to test
1. Create a `.pug-lint.json` file with the rule in place, e.g.:
   ```json
   {
     "disallowIdLiterals": true
   }
   ```
1. Create a folder with one or more `.pug` files that violate the rule
1. Create a `gulpfile.js` at the root of the repo, with the following code:
    ```js
    var gulp = require('gulp')
    var pugLinter = require('./')

    gulp.task('default', ['test'])

    gulp.task('test', function () {
      return gulp
        .src('./**/*.pug')
        .pipe(pugLinter()) // or .pipe(pugLinter('fail'))
        .pipe(pugLinter.reporter())
    })
    ```
1. Run `gulp`

#### unit tests

1. Run `npm run watch` and it will automatically rerun the tests on change

## Commit Guidelines

The commit guidelines are borrowed straight from [AngularJS's Contributing Guide](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines):

> ### Commit Message Format
> Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
> format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

> ```
> <type>(<scope>): <subject>
> <BLANK LINE>
> <body>
> <BLANK LINE>
> <footer>
> ```

> The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

> Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 72 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

> ### Revert
> If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

> ### Type
> Must be one of the following:

> * **feat**: A new feature
> * **fix**: A bug fix
> * **docs**: Documentation only changes
> * **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
> * **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
> * **perf**: A code change that improves performance
> * **test**: Adding missing tests
> * **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

> ### Scope
> The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change.

> ### Subject
> The subject contains succinct description of the change:

> * use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
> * don't capitalize first letter
> * no dot (.) at the end

> ### Body
> Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior. The more verbose, the better.

> ### Footer
> The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.
